THE Loao’s PRAYER 5 5

of justice, with the peace of concord. Deservedly
did he who bore that character in his sacrifice to
God, himself afterwards become a sacrifice to God ;
so that he who had had the Lord’s righteous-
ness and peace should be the first to shew the

example of martyrdom and begin the Lord’s
Passion by the giory of his blood. Such men are

accordingly crowned by the Lord, such will be
avenged1 in the day of judgment with the Lord.
But the one who is quarrelsome and he that is

at enmity and not at peace with the hrethren, as
the blessed Apostle and Holy Scripture testify‚
will nothe able to escape from the charge of
fraternai dissension, even if he should be stain sor
the Name (of Christ), because, as it is written,2 He

wlco lratetlc lais brother is a rarrrrdarem nor does a
murderer attain to the kingdom of heaven or live
with God. He cannot be with Christ who hath
preferred to imitate Judas rather than Christ.
How heinous the sin which not even the Baptism
of blood3 can wash outt· How deep the offence
which not even martyrdom can expiate!

¹ Wndicabuntur: compare Rev. vi. 103 but another read-
ing is judicabunt, “will judge.''

² 1 John iii. 15.

³ On the efficacy of Martyrdom for the pardon os sins

see Tertullian,14pol. 50, de pat. 13, de bapt. 16. He terms it
“a second Baptism.”
