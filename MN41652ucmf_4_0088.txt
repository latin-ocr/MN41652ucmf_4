the way for Christ—himself to decrease and Christ
to increase3 and so the forerunner's work passed
to the Lord. Hence John’s form of 'Prayer has not
be'en preserved, because the earthly has given way
to the heavenl . Let us note three things: first,
Christ's heavenly wisdom in the command to pray
in secret, believing that the eye and the ear of
Almighty God are present under coverings and in ¹
secret places ; secondly, His requiring a modesty
of saith whereby religious service is offered to Him
alone Who heareth and seeth everywhere; thirdly,
His iorbidding us to think that God must be ap-
proached with a multitude of words. This brevity
of the Prayer does but accentuate the breadth of
interpretation possible to its words. The Prayer is
indeed as much expanded in meaning as it is con-
densed in expression. lt embraces not only the
proper sunctions of prayer—worship of God, and
petitioning of man-but almost every teaching of
the Lord, every reminder ol the Christian rule of
life, so that it comprises a breviary of the whole
Gospel.

THE ¹Prayer begins with a testimony to God and
a reward of saith, for we say, OUR FATHER WHO
ART ΙΝ HEAVEN. Herein we both pray to God
and commend the-saith whose reward it is thus to
entitle Him. It is written: To them tlrat believed οη
Him gave He power to¹ br called tlre sons os God.
