Although indeed the Lord harh very frequently Ἴ

proclaimed God to us as a Father‚ and hathmore-
over taught us to call no rnan Father upon earth,
save only Him Whom we have in heaven. So that
in thus praying we obey a commandment.

But in calling Him FATHER we also recognize
Hirn as God. “ FATHER” implies affectionate care
as well as authority. Resides, in the Father the
Son also is invoked3 sor He saith, [arrd tlte Fatlter
are One. Nor is even the Mother Church omitted3
if indeed in the Father and the Son the Mother
also be recognized, from whom the N arne of Father
and Son comes into being.¹

ΙΙΙ

THE Narne of God the Father had been disclosed

to no one. . . . To us it has been revealed in the
Son. For “Son '' is now a new Name of the
Father. I am come, He says, r'n My FotheVs
wama. We ask therefore that this NAME may ΒΕ
HALLOWED, . . . We praythat it may be hallowed
in us who are in Him, and at the same time in ali
others whom the grace of God yet awaiteth. Herein
we obey a commandment in praying for all, even
for our enemies

¹ The thought is obscnrely expressed. Tertullian appears
to mean that the N ame of Father on its divine side implies
the Son, and on its earthly side implies a mother, the Chureh.
So St. Cyprian does not hesitare to say, “He cannot have
God as his Father who has not the Chureh as his Mother ’¹
(De eccl. unit. 6). ⁵
