ΙΤ follows in the Prayer, THY KINGDOM COME.
We ask that God's kingdom may be made present
to us in the same way that we entreat that His
Name may be hallowed in us. For when does God
not reign? or when begins with Him that which
ever was and ever will be?

We ask for our kingdom to come which has been
promised to us by God and won by Christ's Blood
and Passion; so that we who have already served
Him in the world may hereafter reign with Christ
the Lord ; as He Himseli promises when He says:1
Come, γε blessed of M y Ferreae, receive the kingdom
prepared for riou from tlte beginning of tire world

The kingdom oi God, clearly beloved bretlrren,
may also be interpreted of Christ Himself Whom
we daily desire to come, and for Whose Adventwe
pmy, that it may quickly be made present to us.
For as He is the Resurrection‚ because we rise in
Him, so also He may be regarded as the Kingdom
oi Gon, because we are destined to reign in Him.

Now it is well for us to pray ior G0d⁷s kingdom,
that is, a heavenly kingdom, because there is also
an earthly kingdom. But he who has already re-
nounced the world is superior both to its honours
