While in exile cyprian largely relieved the

sufferers from his own still considerable. property,
and this fact shows that his high rank, as ‘vir
horrestior, had procured for him the usual ex-.
emptions from the stricter penalties of the Edict„
On the arrival of the Edict at Karthage the pro-
consul, Galerius Maximus, summoned Cyprian to
>appear before him. The year’s exile thus ended—-
but only to be followed by martyrdom. At first
Cyprian was bidden to confine himself to his own
Gardens at Karthage, for the proconsul lay sick at
Utica; but assoon as Galerius came to Karthage
the Archbishop's trial was held. He refused to
sacrifice, and the inevitable sentence of death was
-received by the saint with an exclamation of
thanksgiving to God. He was led out to the place of
execution, but the headsman's hand was unnerved,
and the centurion himself was obliged to deliver
the stroke. Such was st. Cyprian's “coronation.''
The date was September the 14th.1 He stands
forth as the first African Bishop “who dyed his
sacerdotal diadems in blood.'’²
