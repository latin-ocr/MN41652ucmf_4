offences by a continual sanctification} Now what
that sanctification is which is conferred upon us by
the lovingkindness of God the Apostle declares
when he says :² Nez'tlnr fornz'cntors, nor idolaters,
nor adulteram, nor effeminate, nor seekers after males,
nor tlrievcn nor clients, nor drunleards, nor revilers,
nor mintionem, shall attaz'n n tlte kingdom of God.
And these, indeed, wereye,· but γε were named, γε
werayitstz'fied, ye were sanctzfhd in tlte Ncnne of our ,
Lardsesus clnz'st and in nze spiritvs our God.

He says that we were sanctified in the Name of
the Lord jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
It is this sanctification that we pray may abide in us,
And because our Lord and Judge warns³ the one
who had been healed by Him and granted a new
lise to sin nn more, lest a worse thing come upon him,

’ we ask with continual prayers and request that the

sanctification and renewed life which is received by
God's grace may be preserved by His protecting
care.

¹ On the efficacy of the Lord's Prayer as a daily absolution
see Augustine‚ De civ. Dei, xxi. 27: “The daily prayer which
the Lord Himself taught obliterates the sins of the day, when
day by day we say, Forgive us our debis.” And again, Serm.
ad ίὶιίείβιλ xv.‚ “Semel abluimus baptismate, cottidie abluimus
oratione.”
