CHAPTER XIX

AGAIN, the petition may also be understood in
this way, namely, that we who have renounced the
world and rejected its riches and pomps through
the saith of a spiritual grace, should ask for our-
selves only food and sustenance3 as the Lord
instructed uS, saying :1 He ulio dett not renounce

everytliz'ng that is liis cannot be My dasciple. Now
he who has begun to be a disciple os Christ,
renouncing everything according to his Master’s
words, ought to ask only for his daily food‚ and
not to extend the desires expressed in his prayers

into the future ς as once again the Lord Himseli
prescribes :2 Take no thought for tlte morrono, for
tlte marrow wz'll take thought for itself Sufficiant
unta tlu day is tlte evil thereos. Very properly,
therefore, doth Christ’s disciple ask for sustenance
for himself from day to day, since he is forbidden
. to take thought for the morrow.

Further, it would be an inconsistent and contra-
dictory thing for uc, who pray for God's kingdom
to come quickly, to ask to live long in the world.
Thus also the blessed Apostle admonishes us, sub-
stantiating and strengthening the stedfastness of Ἴ
our hope and saith. We brought nothing into iliis
