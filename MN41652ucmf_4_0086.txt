70 ST. CYPRIAN ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LORD's PRAYER

slothful time-losing in opportunities of prayer.
Let us, spiritually recreated and born again by the
tender merny of God, imitate that which we are
destined to be ; for since in the Kingdom:we shall
have day only without-intervention of night, let us
so watch by night as if in the light5 and¹ since
we are to pray and give thanks to God for ever,

let us not cease here also to offer prayers and
thanksgivinga
