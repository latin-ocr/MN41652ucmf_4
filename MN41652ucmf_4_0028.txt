Valerian had placed in the hands of his Chancellor

enter their cemeteries. ln July 258 a much severer
Edict was published. lt-condemned all clergy to
death3 laics of high rauk tovdegradation and loss
of property, or to death il obstinacy were shewn3

matrons‚ rte. wives not in the power (manus) of
their husbands¹ to confiscation of goods and exile3
and caesarians2 to confiscation os goods and labour
as chained convicts on the Imperial farms. The
Emperor's object evidently was to remove the
officials and leading members of the Church‚ in the

on August 30, and must have left Karthage a little less than
a fortnight later, as he reached Curubis on September 14.—
