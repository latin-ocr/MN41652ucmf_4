The value of the work was very fully recognized
also by St. Augustine, who read it over to some
delegates from the monks at Adrumetum who were
inclined to Pelagianism, and strongly recommended

that, all things which relate to character, whereby
we live rightly, are to be'asked of Our Father in

same subject (De Oratione) by his “master'' Ter-
tullian. 'But if Tertullian provided the rough
