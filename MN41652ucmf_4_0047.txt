THE LonD's PRAYER 31

other man who thus prayed‚ to be sanfflfied,
inasmuch as he placed his hone of salvation, not
in reliance on his own innocence (sor no one is
innocent), hut prayed‚ humbly consessing his
sins. And He Who pardons the humble heard
his prayer. This the Lord sets forth in His >
Gospel‚ and says:1 Twn nnn went np into tna
twnple to pnny, nne a Pnnnsee and one a tnn-
gatham. Tne Pnanlren wlnen ne nnn placed ln'nn-
self, prayed tnns nnn himself .· “Gnd, I tlwnk
Thea wat I nnn nnt as nnn nzen, nnjnst, enor-
tinners, ndnltwern even ns tln's tax-gntlwnw. I fast
twice in tna week; I give nenas ff all wat I
possess.'’ Bnt tna tan-gntnw'er‘ was standing far
nwny, and was nnt even willing tn n'ft nis eyes

nnn heaven, bnt kept snn'tz'ng upon ln's bremt,
snying, ‘¹ Gon, be nwncffnl tn we, n shenerf’ I tell

¹ Luke xviii. rof. >
Ψ One cannot forbear quoting Crashaw's epigram 2-—

“Two went to pray? O rather say
One went to brag, th' other to pray.

One stands up close, and treads on high,
Where th’ other dares not lend his eye.

¹ One nearer to the altar nod,
The other to the altar's Gon?
