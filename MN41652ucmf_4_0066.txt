the Lord reaches us1 that he becomes perfect and
complete who, by selling all that he has and
distributing it for the use of the poor, lays up for
himself treasure in heaven. He says that that
man is able to follow Him and to imitate the glory
of the Lord's Passion who, unimpeded and close-

self unrestricted and free, accompanies his own
possessions which he has already sent before to
God. In order that each one of us may prepare
himself for this, he thus learns to pray, and from
the terms of the prayer to know what manner of
man he ought to be.
