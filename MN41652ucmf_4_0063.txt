Body. Now we request that this Bread be given
to us daily lest vve, who are in Christ, and who
daily receive His Eucharist for food of salvation,
should, by the interposition of sorne heinous crime,
be Withheld frorn communion and forbidden the
heavenly food, and so be separated from the Body
of Christ. This He Himself taught, saying :1 ] am
tlte Bread of Life, olrico came down from heaven.
If arnt one eat of My Bread lte slrall live for ever.
Now tlte Bread wlrr'clr l wr'll give is My Fleslr for
tlte life of tlte world. Since therefore He says that
if any one eat of His Bread he shall live for ever,
as it is manifest that there are those living who
appertain to His Body and receive the Eucharist
by right of communion, so on the other hand we
are bound to fear and pray lest any one, being
withheid from communion and separated from
Christ's Body, remain far frorn salvati0n; according
to His werning,2 Unless ye eat tlte Fleslr of tlte Son
of Man and drz'nk H is Bloodye will not lzave li e in

⁴ou.
¹ yConsequently vve pray that OUR BREAD, that is, ’

Christ, may be given to us DAILY, so that we who
abide and live in Christ may not fall away from
His sanctification and His Body.
