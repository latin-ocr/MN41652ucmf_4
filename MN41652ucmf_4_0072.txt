CHAPTER XXV

FuRTuuRMonu the Lord needfully admonishes

us to say in the Prayer,AND SUFFER Us NOT TO ΒΕ
ruo iuro Turrrrxsiou. Hereby it is shewn that

the adversary can avail nothing against us unless
God previously give him permission; so that all
our sear and devotion and heedfulness should he
turned towards God, since in our temptations no
power is allowed to the evil one save that which is
derived from God. Scripture proves this when it
records¹ that Nebrciradrieaaar‚ki'rzgof Babylon, carne
against Jerusalem aad storrrred it, aad tire Lorri
delivered it into iris rand. Now power is given to
the evil one against us according to our sins, as
it is written ;2 Wao gave Jacob for a spail aad
Israel to tiore tlrat plandered iiiia? Did aot tire
Lord, against erera tlrey sinned, aad refused to
walle ia His ways aad to lrear His lara? aad He
iratirpeared upon taem tirefiiry ef His anger. And
again, when Solomon siuned and fell away from
the commandments and ways of the Lord, it is
recorded:3 And tire Lord stirred ap Satan against
Salomon.

¹ 2 Kings xxiv. 11. ² lsaiah xlii. 25.

³ 1 Kings xi. 14. But the Hebrew word for Satan, which is
merely transliterated by the LXX. and old Latin, is not in
this passage used as a proper name to denote the personal
devil¹ but simply for an adversary.
