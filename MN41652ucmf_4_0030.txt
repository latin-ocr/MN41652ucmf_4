14 INTRODUCTION

53. Tun Duru on Tne Tnnnrrsn. ”

From internal evidence it is clear that Cyprian
was writing at a tirne when it was necessary to
emphasize the duty of unity, brotherhood, and
unanimity (Chaps. viii, ix„ xxiv), subjects which
link this treatise very closely with that “On the
“ Unity of the Church,'' which was written in
An). 251. Further‚ henas writing in the midst
oi persecution, when martyrdom and confessorship
might be every-day occurrences‚ and' when there
was a danger oi arrogance and seli-glorification on
the part of the sufferers (Chap. xxvi). Again‚ the
passages in which he dwells upon the'snares ol
¹ wealth and the duty of dedicating worldly opulence

to the cause of God and His saints gain new force

when we remember how ireely he had surrendered
his own property sor the relies of the victims of

Decius’ Edict. Once again, the manner in which

he urges the splendid privileges and corresponding

duties os Christians as “sons oi God,'' points to the
periodos the Plague and of his bracing exhort·
- ations to the brethren to rise to the opportunity

given them of displaying the character of men ,

“born oi God'' (Chaps. xi, xvii, xxiii).
All these indications lead us to the year AD. 2 52
for the composition of the treatise.
