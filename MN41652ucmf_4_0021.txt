THE little ,work of St. Cyprian’s which is here
presented in an English translation is in a very
true and real sense an‘sunuuu cuuacu cunssrcf
for it was early accorded by the Church the position
of the recognized standard treatisev-on the LORD'S
’ PRAVER. So high was the esteem in which it was
held that St. Hilary of Poitiers, writing just one
hundred years later (ΑΙ). 354), considered himself

, relieved from the task oi commenting on the LORD'S

, PRAVER when, in the course of his Exposition on
St. Mattheus, he came to Chapter vi. 9-13, pre-
ferring rather to send his readers to St. Cyprian's
well-knownbook.1 . ι ’ ¹

St. Ambrose‚ again, in his Commentary on St.

.¹ “De orationis autem sacramento necessitate comment-
andi Cyprianus vir sanctae memoriae liberavit. Quanquam
et Tertullianus hinc volumen aptissimum scripserit ; sed con-
sequens error hominis detraxit scriptis probabilibus auctori·
tatem.'' So St. Hilary. .St.Vincent of Lerins has some
similar remarks in his Commonitory ·(chap.*xviii.). Some
passages from Tertullian's “very appropriate volume ¹’ will
be found below (pages μί).
