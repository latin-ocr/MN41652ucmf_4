CHAPTER XVI

&VIOREOVER we pray that the will os God may be
’ΣΧ done both in heaven and in earth, because each
pertains to the consummation of our safety and
salvationi For since we possess a body from earth
and a spirit from heaven, we are ourselves earth
and heaven3 and in both—that is, in body and in
spirit—we pray that God's will may be done. For ¹
there is a strife between flesh and spirit, a daily
contest as they mutually disagoee, so that we do
not do the things that we would; because while
the spirit seeks what' rs heavenly and divine, the
fiesh desires what' 1s earthly and worldly. And
therefore we pray that by the assistance and help ἓ
of God there may be agreement between theset two,·
so that when the will of God' 1s done both' 1n the
spirit andin the fiesh, the soul which has been re-
born through Him may be preserved. yThis is what
the Apos tle Paul openly and plainly declares' 1n his
words z1 Tite flasli lassata against tlte spira aad ila
