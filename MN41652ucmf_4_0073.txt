CHAPTER XXVI

IN truth power is given to be used against us
for a twofold purpose-for punishment when we
sin, and for glory when we are proved; as we
see in the case of Job, for God makes this clear,
saying:1Beeoetallteurle leetle I give iete tley
eerrds; bet beeeaee teat tleeu teeele eet tle enen
lrieeseffi And the Lord in the Gospel speaks in
the hour of His Passion :2 T hee woeldest leave ee
power against Me except it lead been given teee frere
above.

Now when we entreat thar we may not come
into temptation, we are warned by these words
of our own infirmity and weakness, lest any one
should insolently exalt himself, proudly and arro-
gantly assuming aught=t0 himself, counting the
glory of confession or> of suffering as his own;
whereas the Lord Himself taught humility in the
injunction,3 Wetelr aed prey, lert ye ceree inte
templatim. T ire spirit indeed is eedheg, better
flesle is weae. {Thus a humhle and submissive con-
fession comes first, and everything is referred to

God, so that whatever we as suppliants ask in the “

fear and reverence pf God may be supplied by His
Fatherly kindness. ÷
