CHAPTER xv ’

NOW the will of God is that which Christ did and f
taught. It is humility in conduct, stability in saith,
modesty in words, justice in deeds, mercy in works,
strictness in morah, unwillingness to do wrong, and ·
witlingness to endure wrong: it is to preserve peace
with our brethren‚ to love God with our whole
heart, to have affection for Him as our Father, to

fear Him as our God, to prefer nothing before

⁴ Christ because He preferred nothing before us, to

chng inseparably to His Iove, to stand bravely and

faithfully by His Cross, and ivhen the contest
comes for His Name and Honour‚ to shew forth in
speech a constancy whereby we become confessors‚ Lf
in torture a fidelity whereby we defy the foe, and
in death a patience wherefor we receive the crown.

This it is to endeavour to be co-heir with Christ,
this it is to do the will of God, this it is to futfit the
will of the Father.
