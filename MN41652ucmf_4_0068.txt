52 ST. CYPRIAN ΟΝ

God3 and that provision be made not only for the
present and temporal life, but also for the eterna,
whereuuto we may corne if our sins are pardoned,
—sins which the Lord calls OUR¹ DEBTS, as He
says in His Gospel, l sorgave thee all tlzy deit
because thou desiredst Mul

How necessarily, how prudently, and how salu-
tarily are we admonished that we are sinuers by
being compelled fo make petition for our sins, so
that while forgiveness is asked of God the mind is
recalled to a sense of its guill! Lest any one
should be sels-satisfied as though innocent, and
by extolling himself should meet with the worse
(loom, he is instructed and taught that he sins
dassy, so long as he is bidden daily to entreat
for his sins. Thus, for instance, John also in his
Epistle warns us, saying :² Is we say that we have
πο sin zue deceive ourselves arad the trulla is not in
us,· but is we stava made coaffessiort of our sins, the
Lord zafaitlrflll andjast tosurgive us arta* sins.

In his Epistle he has embraced both parts,
namely, that we ought to make request for our
sins, and that we shall obtain pardon when we ask.
Hence he said that the Lord was faithful to forgive
our sins, maintaining the fidelity of His =promise3
because He Who has taught us to pray for our
debts and sins has promised that the Father's
mercy and pardon shall follow.
