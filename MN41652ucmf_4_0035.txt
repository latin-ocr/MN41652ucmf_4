This form os the petition in fact first appears in

Cyprian, and won its way into some manuscripts
from current devotional use.
'tt is the idea of the Divine permission in tempt-

atlonv that isprominent, derived no doubt srom the
scenes depicted in the opening chapters of the
Book of Μ), and verbally indebted to St. Paul’s
words in 1 Cor. x. 13. Sometimes this last text is
combined with 1 Tim. vi. 9, as in alragment of
Dionysius os Alexandria, who explains LEAD US
nor turo Tniiumnou, that is, ‘¹ Do not suffer us
to sall into temptation.”1 Similarly, some of the
early Liturgies added in the embolismus the words
‘¹ such as ue are not able to bear,” from 1 Cor. x. 132
With insertions like these we may compare the
liturgical doxology which has wedded itself with
the eucharistie employment of the Prayer from very
early times.3

It may nothe out of place to mention here
another early variant in the Western textos the
Prayer: LET THY HOLY SPIRIT COME UPON US

pluribus, et hoc sic posuit beatissimus Cyprianus: Ne
parturis nos induci in tentationem. In evangelio tamen
graeco nusquam inveni nisi Ne nos instrat in tentatioriem.’¹
