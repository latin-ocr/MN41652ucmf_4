We add, THv wne BE nove ΙΝ harven Ano
ΙΝ EARTH. Not that any· one can hinder the
doing of God¹s will, but we ask that His will may
bedone in all men. For by a figurative interpret-
ation of flesh and spirit we are heaven and earth.
Although even if it is to be understood simply, the
sense of the petition is the same3 namely, that in .
us the will of God may be done in earth, so that it
rnay be done in heaven also. Now what doth God
will, save that we· should wall< according to His
rule? We ask Him therefore to supply us with
the substance and power of His will that we may
be saved both in heaven and in earth, seeing that
'the surn of His will is the salvation 01 those whom
He has adopted. That atso is the· will of God
which the Lord performed in preaching'‚ in working,
and in enduring. For so did He Himself declare,
that He did not His own will but the will of the

Father. . .. . .
Likewise when we say THY WILL ΒΕ DONE, we
wish well to ourselves, because there is naught of
, evil in the will of God, even if according to the
deserts of each somewhat contrariwise be inflicted.

In so saying then we exhort ourselves unto
patience .....

V ,

THY KINGDOM COME has the same reference
as THv wne BE oows, namely, in ourselves.
